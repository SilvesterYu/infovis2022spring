Among different types of heart diseases, coronary heart disease constitutes a major portion of the mortality. The disease occurs when cholesterol layers deposit on the inner wall of coronary arteries and narrow the lumens of the arteries. The process reduces blood supply to cardiac muscle and causes exertional chest pain known as angina. In fact, Heart disease, along with stroke and blood vessel disease, belongs to the group of conditions together known as cardiovascular disease (CVD).<br><br>We provide you with tools of:<br><br>1) An interactive combination of bar chart and pie chart that help you to check the connections between diseases and bad habits.<br><br>2) An interactive treemap that presents a multi-dimensional diagonosis of heart diseases.</p><p class="note">Don't worry-- We help you with a quick diagonsis!</p><p class="TransitionTitle">Scroll Down To see More</p><div id="root"></div><div><p class="TransitionTitle">About Us</p><p class="blockquote2">The datasets of our diagnosis comes from Kaggle.
